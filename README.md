README for JSON File Analyzer Script
Overview

The JSON File Analyzer is a Python script designed for searching and extracting specific data from JSON files in a selected directory. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use, allowing users to specify search parameters and fields to be extracted. The script is particularly useful for sifting through large collections of JSON files to find and aggregate relevant data based on user-defined criteria.
Features

    Search Functionality: Search for a specific string within JSON files.
    Selective Data Extraction: Extract specific fields from JSON files based on user selection.
    Progress Tracking: GUI displays progress when processing files.
    File Output: Aggregates and exports the collected data to a JSON file in a chosen directory.
    Error Handling: Displays error messages for any issues encountered during processing.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    tkinter (for GUI components)
    os and json (for file and data handling)
    threading (for background processing)

Installation

No specific installation process is required, as the script utilizes standard Python libraries. Simply ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Usage

    Launch the Script: Run the script to open the GUI.
    Set Parameters:
        Search String: Enter a string to search within the JSON files.
        Field Selection: Check the fields to extract from the JSON files.
        JSON Folder: Choose the folder containing the JSON files.
        Output Folder: Select the folder for saving the output file.
    Process Files: Click "Process Files" to start the operation. A progress bar will indicate the ongoing process.
    Output: On completion, a JSON file with the aggregated data is saved in the selected output folder.

Notes

    The script is designed for .json files. Other file types are not supported.
    Ensure the fields selected for extraction exist in the JSON files for accurate results.
    The GUI requires tkinter, which is included in standard Python distributions.

Troubleshooting

    If the script does not start, verify that Python 3.x is installed and added to your system's PATH.
    For issues with tkinter not found, ensure Python is fully installed with its standard library.
